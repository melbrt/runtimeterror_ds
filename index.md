Movies have the unique ability to take us on an emotional journey and transport us to different worlds. Whether we're laughing at the antics of a comedy, rooting for the hero in an action flick, or shedding a tear at a heart-wrenching drama, the silver screen has the power to move us in ways that few other forms of entertainment can. 

The film industry is a multi-billion dollar business, with millions of people around the globe flocking to theaters each year to be entertained and touched by the magic of movies. Movies have the power to shape and reflect culture and society, and some films become cultural touchstones that leave a lasting impact on the world. No matter what genre you prefer or what kind of story you enjoy, there is a movie out there for everyone to love and cherish.

Have you ever been completely captivated by a movie, hanging on every twist and turn of the plot until the very end? That's the power of a well-crafted narrative. But have you ever stopped to think about the types of stories that tend to capture our attention and hold it until the credits roll? In this blog, we set out to investigate the most popular narratives in the film industry, how profitable they are, and how these storylines evolve over time.

To do this, we will examine the movie plots in the CMU Movie Corpus dataset and split them into sentences. We will then perform sentiment analysis on each sentence to construct the various movie arcs and analyze the emotions present in each film. This will allow us to see how these emotions evolve throughout the course of the movie and understand the most prevalent narrative arcs.

Join us as we delve into the world of movie storytelling and uncover the secrets of the most compelling plots. Who knows, maybe we'll even discover the formula for the perfect movie!

## Let us tell you a little story about data

The CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset consists of 42,306 movie plot summaries and its meta data. It varies from drama to adventure all the way to fantasy and musicals.

Drama, Comedy, Thriller/Action, Romance, and Horror are the kings and queens of the genre world! No shocker there, right? These categories always come out on top and dominate the charts. They're just too darn popular to ignore!

We will create four datasets for analysis, focusing on the genres of drama, comedy, thriller/action, and horror. Horror was chosen over romance because romantic movies often overlap with both drama and comedy in their secondary genre classification

### Movie arcs
By grouping the most common genres into the four main genres action, comedy, drama and horror, which are all very different from each other. But in this little data story, sentiment analysis plays the main role. For every movie, each sentence in the summary gets a continuous sentiment value assigned. This shapes the arc throughout the plot summary.


Not only do the arcs differ between the genres but also in the genre itself. With the help of Kmeans clustering, the three most common arcs are derived. By clicking on each genre, the most common clusters and their fraction are shown.
